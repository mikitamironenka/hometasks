enjoy the silence

They can only do harm
Words are very unnecessary
Is here in my arms
All I ever needed
All I ever wanted
They can only do harm
Words are very unnecessary
Is here in my arms
All I ever needed
All I ever wanted
They can only do harm
Words are very unnecessary
Is here in my arms
All I ever needed
All I ever wanted
And forgettable
Words are meaningless
So does the pain
Pleasures remain
Words are trivial
Feelings are intense
To be broken
Vows are spoken
They can only do harm
Words are very unnecessary
Is here in my arms
All I ever needed
All I ever wanted
Oh my little girl
Can't you understand
Pierce right through me
Painful to me
Into my little world
Come crashing in
Break the silence
Words like violence
